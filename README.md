# Image_Captioning
 The neural network architecture which automatically generate captions from images.

Project Instructions:

The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:
sequential order:

    0_Dataset:
    Step 1: Initialize the COCO API 
    Step 2: Plot a sample image
    
    1_Preliminaries:
    Step 1: Explore the Data Loader
    Step 2: Use the Data Loader to Obtain Batches
    Step 3: Experiment with the CNN Encoder
    Step 4: Implement the RNN Decoder
    
    2_Training:
    Step 1: Training Setup
    Step 2: Train your Model
    
    3_Inference:
    Step 1: Get Data Loader for Test Dataset
    Step 2: Load Trained Models
    Step 3: Finish the Sampler
    Step 4: Clean up Captions
    Step 5: Generate Predictions!

  

You MUST enable GPU mode for this project. 

Please note, a completely trained model is expected to take between 5-12 hours to train well on a GPU.
